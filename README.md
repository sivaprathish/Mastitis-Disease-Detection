Mastitis is a common and costly disease affecting dairy cows, characterized by inflammation of the mammary glands. It leads to reduced milk production, poor milk quality, increased veterinary costs, and potential harm to animal welfare. 

Clinical Mastitis: This is the most recognizable form of mastitis, characterized by visible signs of inflammation in the udder.

Subclinical Mastitis: Subclinical mastitis is not visibly apparent but can be detected through laboratory tests.
